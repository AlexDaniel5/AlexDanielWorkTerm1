                Aurora Cannabis Inc. is a rapidly expanding player in the global cannabis market, boasting eight production facilities across Canada. Aurora Cannabis emerged in 2006 with a primary focus on medical cannabis; the company has since evolved to meet the growing demand for recreational cannabis following legalization movements. Aurora now serves markets in Europe, Australia, Israel, Germany, and more. The company offers a diverse range of products, available through thirteen different brands, eleven domestically and two internationally.<br><br>
                I was employed by the River facility located in Bradford, Ontario, to collaborate closely with the Data Research Team. Our focus is to research how various fertilizers, lighting conditions, climate variables, and crop management practices impact the company's profitability, thereby reinforcing the organization's decision-making process with evidence.

            <h1>Data Technician Role</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The data team at River is small, but we collaborate biweekly with other data analysts at different facilities to share insights and brainstorm ideas. Our main objective is to improve yield while ensuring THC levels comply with legal limits in various countries. Additionally, we are exploring cost-cutting measures as part of our strategy to increase profitability, rather than solely focusing on yield improvements.<br><br>
                Over these four months, I've experienced significant growth, especially in organizing and presenting data using Excel and R at an advanced level. I've learned when to effectively utilize surface graphs, area graphs, and data filtering on the front-end with PowerBI.

                        <li>Developed R scripts to automate the generation of monthly reports, replacing manual efforts and reducing repetitive labor.</li>
                        <li>Utilized R scripts to visualize climate data, graphing the standard deviation of yield across growing rooms.</li>
                        <li>Mapped climate data in Excel to analyze variations across different growing rooms. Identified potential issues during night cycles that correlated with an increase in pest activity, supported by academic research.</li>
                        <li>Integrated and standardized diverse crop work data from multiple Excel formats using R and Excel commands. Transformed the consolidated data into Power BI graphs to illustrate which cultivars require the most crop work, compare worker efficiency against expectations, and analyze labor cost fluctuations over recent months, attributing increases to probable causes.</li>

            <h1>Summer Goals</h1>
            <h2>Reading Google Scholar Articles Instead of General Web Articles</h2>
            <p class="padding-less-paragraph">
                During meetings, colleagues frequently discuss and interpret data to draw conclusions. As I gained experience, I realized that presenting ideas without supporting evidence is often seen as mere opinion and can be easily dismissed. The most credible insights come from evidence-backed academic articles. By the end of my summer term, I refined my presentation approach. For instance, when speculating on how pests might respond to specific temperatures, I began using graphs from academic studies showing mortality rates against temperature to strengthen my hypotheses.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Scientific Communication</h2>
            <p class="padding-less-paragraph">
                School has always encouraged students to participate actively during meetings and express their opinions freely. However, my experience at Aurora Cannabis has taught me the importance of speaking only when I have valuable insights to contribute, as unnecessary opinions can detract from the efficiency of meetings. During this work term, my objective was to learn the balance between speaking and listening effectively. I feel I have significantly evolved over the past four months, using strong visual cues to show engagement with others' contributions. Additionally, I aim to come prepared to meetings with notes outlining essential points I wish to discuss if relevant topics arise in conversation.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Sense of Historical Development</h2>
            <p class="padding-less-paragraph">
                When analyzing data, it's essential to revisit past projects and conclusions from previous company work. Equally important is referencing my own completed projects during this term. For instance, when asked about the organization's worst-performing cultivar, I can draw on insights from analyzing male counts in 2022 and pest counts in the mother room. This approach ensures decisions are based on actual results rather than relying solely on recent events or intuition.

            <p class="paragraph">
                Overall, this summer internship has provided me with the hands-on experience I've been seeking. I've come to understand that a career may not always align with its portrayal, such as omitting an X-axis title when it's inherently understood, which can be more effective than including it and potentially causing confusion. Moreover, I've learned the importance of referencing external articles in discussions.
                <br><br>
                Initially hesitant to pursue the Co-op stream in Computer Science, this experience at Aurora Cannabis has equipped me with invaluable skills. I now feel empowered to ask more insightful questions, drawing on my newfound knowledge, and I am enthusiastic about embarking on a career in data analysis with confidence.

            <h1>Acknowledgements</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
                I wasn't alone during this summer work term. I owe a huge thanks to Victoria Rodriguez, who provided constructive criticism that resonated with my desire for personal growth. Her feedback on both my strengths and weaknesses was invaluable, and she encouraged me to develop habits for organizing a consistent schedule and sticking to a plan.
                <br><br>
                I would also like to thank my co-op coordinator, Anne-Marie Zawadzki, and the Manager of Co-operative Education Operations, Arran Tyre. They guided me through challenging situations and provided invaluable lessons about the business world that I wouldn't have gained in a classroom. Their understanding and constructive feedback encouraged me to take actions I initially felt uncomfortable with, giving me the push I needed to adapt to a workplace environment.</p>
